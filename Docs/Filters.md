Filters
=======

A Filter provides ways to manipulate a stream. It is bound to a specific channel, and may add presentation data to the stream, in a way that is specific for each channel.

A Filter behaves as a Source. That is, it implements the same methods and events.

Namespaces
----------

Filters are namespaced by channel: `MooGIS.Filter.<Channel>.<Implementation>`.
